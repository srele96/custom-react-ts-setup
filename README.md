# Custom React setup *(my very first & messy)*.
This was my **VERY FIRST, CUSTOM & BASIC SETUP** of *React, TypeScript and Webpack*.

---

## Available scripts
`npm start` - Starts webpack dev server.
`npm run build` - Creates production build output.

---

## Note!
1. **This was for learning purposes**
2. **I published this for sake of proof that I've done it myself**
3. *I'll do it better every next time i have to setup this stuff*
